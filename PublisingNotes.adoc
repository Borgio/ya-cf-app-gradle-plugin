## Publishing to Maven Central

The released artifacts are published to Maven central via Sonatype repository, the details of how the priveleges were obtained is http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html[here]

To release from your desktop first add the credentials related to Sonatype(ossrh) in a gradle.properties file in your ~/.gradle directory,
note that this should be totally private to your machine and should never be shared.

[source]
----
signing.keyId=GPG_KEY_ID
signing.password=GPG_PASSEORD
signing.secretKeyRingFile=Signing Key Ring..

ossrhUsername=user
ossrhPassword=password
----

If all of the above is cleanly set, the artifact can be published using the command:

[source]
----
./gradlew uploadArchives
----

It takes about 10 mins before the artifacts are visible via maven and 2 hours before it is searchable.


Additionally for versioned releases:
* go https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories[here]
* search for comgithubpivotalservices
* Close the release
* Then click on "Release"
