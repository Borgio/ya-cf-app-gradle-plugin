== Yet another Gradle plugin to deploy an application to Cloud Foundry.

image:https://travis-ci.org/pivotalservices/ya-cf-app-gradle-plugin.svg?branch=master["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.org/pivotalservices/ya-cf-app-gradle-plugin"]

The purpose of this plugin is to provide ways to manage the deployment of an application to a Cloud Foundry Environment - 
Be able to deploy, update, start/stop/restart application, attach/remove routes, create/bind services/CUPS.

"Yet another" because the authoritative source of Cloud Foundry Gradle plugin is expected to be with the https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-java-client[CF-Java-Client project].


=== Using the Plugin

Start by looking at a sample project using the plugin https://github.com/bijukunjummen/cf-show-env[here]

==== Details

* Add a buildscript dependency:

[source]
----
buildscript {
	ext {
		cfAppVersion = '1.0.9'
	}
	repositories {
		mavenCentral()
		maven { url "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases" }
		maven { url "https://repo.spring.io/release" }
	}
	dependencies {
		classpath("com.github.pivotalservices:ya-cf-app-gradle-plugin:${cfAppVersion}")
	}
}

apply plugin: 'cf-app'
----

OR Via the new Gradle plugins mechanism:
[source]
----
plugins {
	id "com.github.pivotalservices.cf-app" version "1.0.9"
}
----

* Provide the Cloud Foundry connectivity and application details:

[source]
----

cfConfig {
	//CF Details
	ccHost = "api.local.pcfdev.io"
	ccUser = "admin"
	ccPassword = "admin"
	org = "pcfdev-org"
	space = "pcfdev-space"

	//App Details
	name = "cf-show-env"
	hostName = "cf-show-env"
	filePath = "build/libs/cf-show-env-0.1.2-SNAPSHOT.jar"
	path = ""
	domain = "local.pcfdev.io"
	instances = 2
	memory = 512

	//Env and services
	buildpack = "https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git"
	environment = ["JAVA_OPTS": "-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom", "SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE": "cloud"]
	services  = ["mydb"]
}
----

* Run the task(s):

[source]
----
./gradlew cf-push
----

* Override the values using explicit gradle properties, they follow a `cf.*` pattern:

[source]
----
./gradlew cf-push -Pcf.name=Green -Pcf.hostName=demo-time-temp
----

* There is one task to retrieve the details of an application (cf-get-app-detail).
You can use this task in the following way, say to retrieve the app url's in a gradle task:

[source]
----
task showAppUrls(dependsOn: "cf-get-app-detail") << {
	print "${project.cfConfig.applicationDetail.urls}"
}
----

or if you want to run an acceptance test you can define a task alone these lines:

[source]
----
task acceptanceTest(type: Test, dependsOn: "cf-get-app-detail")  {
	doFirst() {
		systemProperty "url", "https://${project.cfConfig.applicationDetail.urls[0]}"
	}
	useJUnit {
		includeCategories 'test.AcceptanceTest'
	}
}
----

NOTE: A sample project demonstrating the plugin is availble https://github.com/bijukunjummen/cf-show-env[here]

=== Using the Plugin for a https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/blue-green.html[Blue-Green] Application Deployment

The plugin natively understands how to perform the steps of a Blue-Green deploy. Just run the following and you should be set for a Blue-Green deploy:

[source]
----
./gradlew cf-push-blue-green
----

You may want to run smoke tests after a new version of the app with a new route is brought up before replacing the existing app,
if so a smoke test dependency can be added in the `build.gradle` file the following way:

[source]
----
"cf-push-blue-green-1"{finalizedBy "test"}
----

and run

[source]
----
./gradlew cf-push-blue-green
----

=== Using the Plugin for a https://github.com/concourse/autopilot[Autopilot] equivalent deployment

The plugin natively understands how to perform the steps of an Autopilot based deploy. Just run the following on the command line:

[source]
----
./gradlew cf-push-autopilot
----


=== Creating services

Services can be created and automatically bound to the app in the targeted org and space by providing information the following way:

[source, java]
----
    cfService {
        name = "p-mysql"
        plan = "512mb"
        instanceName = "test-db"
    }
    
    cfService {
        name = "p-rabbitmq"
        plan = "standard"
        instanceName = "test-rabbitmq"
    }
    
    cfUserProvidedService {
        instanceName = "mydb1"
        credentials = ["jdbcUri": "someuri1"]
    }
----
